WSPBuilder
by Carsten Keutmann

The WSPbuilder is a console application that creates SharePoint Solutions files
based on a folder structure. WSPBuilder will automatically traverse a "12" folder structure
and create the SharePoint solution manifest.xml and the wsp file based on the files it finds.
Therefore knowledge of how to create a solution manifest.xml and wsp file is not needed any more.

The folder structure that WSPBuilder uses to build the wsp file is actually the same folder
stucture you will find in: "%Program Files%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12"
So all that you have to do, is the create a \12 folder in your project and add your files to
that folder matching the same structure as if you where to put them directly into the
"%Program Files%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12" folder manually.

Lets say that you have created a SharePoint feature and you want to create a SharePoint Solution
for this feature. Then you just need to create the following folder structure in you project
directory: "[MyProject]\12\Template\Features\MyCustomFeature\" and put your feature files in
the MyCustomFeature folder, that being your feature. Then run the WSPBuilder from the your project
directory and it will automatically create the manifest.xml and pack it into a wsp file using the
content of the "\12" folder.

The WSPBuilder program fully supports the SharePoint Solution Schema meaning that it is possible
to create any kind of manifest.xml just by using folders. If the Solution Schema supports it, then
WSPBuilder can build it.

WSPBuilder simply saves you for doing the following:
------------------------------------------------------
No need for manually creating the manifest.xml file.
No need for manually specifying the DDF file.
No need for using makecab.exe

The WSPBuilder comes as an open source project under the GPL license.

Please read the manual for more details on how to use the WSPBuilder program.

Versions
---------------------
0.9.8.0830
Local config files are now supported with wspbuilder. Just put the same wspbuilder.exe.config into your local projects and modify them to your needs.
Bug fixed. Query Status warnings is now written to the Trace and not to a MessageBox.

0.9.8.0827
The previous version 0.9.8.0822 was a memory eating monster, now the memory foot print has been greatly reduced to a more acceptable level.


0.9.8.0822
Assembly element tags in the manifest.xml placed in the top of the manifest.xml file.
Resolvement of assemblies is now supported with Mono.Cecil in order to create relevant SafeControl tags. Use the -DLLRefencePath argument to resolve referenced assemblies.
Bug fixed where the 80\WPResources was not included-.
Bug fixed where the security attributes was not reflected correctly.



0.9.8.0408
Assembly reflection is now done with the Mono.Cecil project. This enables the WSPBuilder to reflect on assemblies without having to load all depending assemblies. 
Because of Mono.Cecil, reflection on types to make SafeControls are not able to detect if a control is inherited from a WebControl. This is because that depending assemblies are not loaded.
Code Access Security declaration in the manifest.xml have been improved for DLLs in the 80\Bin folder.
-PermissionSetLevel do NOT support Unrestricted PermissionSet. Because its not possible to add this to the manifest.xml.
-DLLReferencePath are now obsolete.



0.9.8.0206
Assembly resolvement has been updated. Now if multiple assemblies found with the same name, only the newest assembly is used.
WSPBuilder.exe now returns a 0 (int) when success full, otherwise a 1 when an exception has occurred.
The argument -Install have been added.
The argument -Uninstall have been added.
The argument -deploy now uninstalls the solution before reinstalling and deploying if the solution exist in SharePoint.
Minor bug with excludedfiletypes have been fixed.
Documentation has been corrected to the new versions of WSPBuilder.


0.9.8.0109
A warning problem with features solved.


0.9.7.1227
-BuildSolution is now fixed. This enables you to build multiple projects into one WSP file.
Multiple files with the same name (location) in CAB file have been solved. 
Assembly resolve now outputs better error description - bin\debug and bin\release is now supported.
Bug fixed with ProjectDLLPath argument.
Feature warning corrected.

The -Retract argument now works again.
The -Createfolders argument have been changed and fixed.
A bug with inner exceptions looping fixed.
Build from \GAC and \80\bin fixed.



0.9.7.1205
The WSPDeploy.exe has now been implementet into the WSPBuilder.exe, this means that deployment is now done from the WSPBuilder.exe. However this means that you properly can not build from a non SharePoint environment.
The argument -CustomCAS have been added. This enables you to specify a custom CAS for the solution. See the manual.txt.
The argument -Deploy and -Retract have been added to support deployment.
The argument -projectpath and -solutionpath have been added. This enables you define a path to where the project i located.
The argument -BuildCAB have been added. If set to true then a WSP 'Cab' file will be generated. If false the manifest.xml and DDF can still be created.
UnmanagedDLL support added. It is now possible to include unmanaged DLL's to the WSP package. Will always be added to the WebApplication bin folder.
Build from bin\debug and bin\release fixed.
Problem with assembly resolment fixed. Thanks to Alex Henderson.
Problem with some files not been excluded fixed. Thanks to Alex Henderson.

The argument -CreateWSPFileList have been added. Creates text file, where every file added to the WSP package are specified. 
The argument -Includefiles have been added. Uses the file created from the -CreateWSPFileList argument.
The argument -Excludefiles have been added. Uses the file created from the -CreateWSPFileList argument.
The argument -TraceLevel have been added. This controls the level of console output from the program. The -silence argument is now obsolete.

The argument -BuildMode have been added. This helps to determine where to get the DLL's when build a solution.
Assembly resolvment should not be affected by Global Assembly Cache any more and resolve the specified folders before default.
Minor bugs fixed.
CABLIB.DLL x64 have been created. This is to be used on the Windows Server 2003 x64. (Not for the IA64).
